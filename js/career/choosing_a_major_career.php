        <h3>How to Choose a Career</h3>
        
        <br>
        
        <h4>Career Planning Guide</h4>
        <p>
        The Career Planning Guide allows students to understand the steps to successfully launch into a post-college career. 
        Along with a set of goals for each year of college, the guide lists four career management functions that 
        are necessary to successfully self-manage one's career. (1) Career exploration and self-discovery is an 
        introspective process to learn about oneself and how to apply one's attributes and interests to the world-of-work. 
        (2) Communication tools such as effective resumes and interviewing skills are basic elements of a job search. 
        (3) A successful strategy for identifying opportunities takes the job search to an operationalized level. (4) 
        Effective and prolific networking finds opportunities that are not formally advertised. <a target="_blank" href="/services/career/files/CareerPlanningGuide.pdf">Learn more...</a>

        <h4>Career Planning Myths</h4>
        
        <p class="question">An interest inventory will tell me what I should do.</p>
        <ul class="questionBullet">
           <li>Interest inventories are good at measuring interests. However, a student also needs to 
           consider abilities, values, experiences, and practical considerations (expenses, opportunities, 
           family issues, etc.) An interest inventory is rarely sufficient.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="question">Indecision is abnormal. "There's something wrong with me if I'm undecided."</p>
        <ul class="questionBullet">
           <li>Indecision is normal. Everybody has a different path and takes different amounts of time to 
           make career decisions. Indecision is only really a problem when you choose to do nothing about it. 
           If you are engaging in career exploratory activities, you are on the right track.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="question">I need to decide today.</p>
        <ul class="questionBullet">
           <li>This is the myth perpetuated by those who think that career decision-making is an event 
           rather than a process. Making a decision prematurely, or based on inaccurate or insufficient 
           information, is invariably a mistake. Even if it means changing your academic plans, give 
           yourself time to make an intelligent and unrushed career plan.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="question">Once I choose a career I'm stuck for life.</p>
        <ul class="questionBullet">
           <li>The average adult doesn't settle on a career until their 30's. Your interests, 
           values, abilities and aspirations may be different ages 20, 30, 40 and beyond. If so, 
           you change or modify your career accordingly. Changing careers is only a problem if you 
           think it is. Because of our society's dynamism, you can expect to have several careers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="question">My career choice must please my parents, friends, neighbors, etc.</p>
        <ul class="questionBullet">
           <li>The approval of others is nice, but it is not essential to your career well-being. 
           If others care about you, they'll probably be delighted if your career brings you happiness 
           and fulfillment. It's unfortunate if others aren't pleased with what you're doing, but it's not the end of the world.

        <h3>How To Choose A Major</h3>
        
        <p>Choosing a Major vs. Choosing a Career - Which is first?</p>
        
        <p>
        There is no easy, one-size-fits all approach. Either requires information gathering and perspective to make a decision.
        </p>
        
        <p class="listing"> If you review the majors available at NEIU, you will</p>
        
        <ul class="listingBullet">
           <li>Select those academic departments that interest you.</li>
           <li>Explore the coursework by reviewing the departments websites and speaking with the faculty.</li>
           <li>From this information, limit your interests to two or three departments, and</li>
           <li>Register for courses in these areas.</li>
           <li>Confer with a career counselor/advisor.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        There is nothing wrong with being undecided about a major or career, but during college, individuals begin to explore 
        their options. This process continues after college, because workers must continuously adapt to increasingly dynamic 
        and fast-changing work environments. So, career planning and development is on-going. This allows, and often forces, 
        workers to have several careers. With increasing life-expectancy, you can work many years in each. So, if you like 
        more than one academic subject area, you might not want to limit yourself. Perhaps, you can make one subject a minor. 
        In any case, you should complement your main academic interest with other elective classes. Remember, to an employer, 
        the significance of your completion of a college degree means that you can receive training and instruction, communicate 
        both verbally and in writing, use analytical reasoning, and meet deadlines. Finishing the degree is the most important, 
        the particular major less so. The chose of a major does not dictate what you'll be doing for the rest of your life.

           <h3>Talking To Your Parents About Your Career Concerns</h3>
           
           <p>These suggestions may apply if you are attempting to resolve your career indecision.</p>
           <br>
           
           <h5>Keep the lines of communication open.</h5>
           <p>
           Arrange a time(s) to discuss your career decision with your parents. By doing so, you demonstrate that 
           you value their support and opinions and that you are taking the decision seriously. Communication is 
           two-way: Talk to them and listen to them. If they don't already, request that they do the same.
           </p>
           
           <br>
           
           <h5>Demonstrate to your parents that you are dealing with the situation in a mature manner.</h5>
           <p>
           Share the steps that you are taking to resolve your indecision or to outline your career 
           planning/preparation. Share your strategies by outlining them in a step-by-step, logical fashion.
           </p>
           
           <br>
           
           <h5>Be specific.</h5>
           <p>
           Parents may react unfavorably if you are keeping them in the dark. So, deal with specifics. 
           For example, if you are receiving career counseling, describe what has been discussed (e.g.-
           work values, interest themes, results of assessments, etc.) You need not reveal all that has 
           been covered in counseling, only those items that you are comfortable revealing and enough 
           to show the comprehensiveness of the approach.
           </p>
           
           <br>
           
           <h5>Present the facts.</h5>
           <p>
           Along with the item above, present factual information is helpful to update your parent's 
           perspective if it is outdated or inaccurate. Examples: Starting salaries, company hiring 
           practices, or employment projections predicted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
           </p>
           
           <br>
           
           <h5>Supplement your decision with available printed material.</h5>
           <p>
           Facts speak for themselves, and the paper they're printed on paints the picture. Use 
           assessment result reports, career books from the library, print-outs from career 
           websites, course catalog descriptions, and handouts from Career Services.
           </p>
           
           <br>
           
           <h5>Be assertive.</h5>
           <p>
           Say what's on your mind and express your feelings and opinions honestly and openly. Afford your parents the same courtesies.
           </p>
