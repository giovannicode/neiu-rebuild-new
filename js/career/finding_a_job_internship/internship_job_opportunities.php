        <p>
        Internships offer the opportunity for junior and senior level students to explore a certain career field as 
        well as offer practical experience in a career related area. An internship experience will enhance any resume 
        and give the student a distinct advantage in his or her job search. Career Advising assists students in 
        finding internship positions. Over 500 internships are listed with the Career Advising office each year 
        by employers in Illinois and from across the United States. Internships may be paid, on a volunteer 
        basis or for academic credit. The vast majority of internships are for undergraduate students.
