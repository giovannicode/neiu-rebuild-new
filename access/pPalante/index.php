        Students in this program are given a two-year adjustment period to meet University academic 
        requirements. They must actively participate in the assistance programs provided and show 
        evidence of academic progress. Students receive guidance and support from an academic 
        advisor until the requirements to declare a major are met.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In addition, the program offers integral information about transitioning and excelling in college, via 3-credit academic
         transition courses taught by Proyecto Pa'Lante advisors. These courses complement the program's 
        objectives to provide personal and academic support services designed to increase scholastic achievement and persistence towards graduation.
