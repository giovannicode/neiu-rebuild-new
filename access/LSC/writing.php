<h4>Learning Support Center Writing Tutors</h4>
<p>LSC writing tutors are trained to assist all students currently enrolled in university classes in which writing is involved by offering individualized one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p>Our tutors are experienced writers who work with students on all phases of their writing process. Our goal is to collaborate with the student to help them develop their own strategies for writing. Upon request, a tutor may assess a student's writing and will suggest strategies for improving a paper, but our focus is on making better writers. As students make return visits with writing tutors, they become more self-directed and open to new ways of looking at writing.</p> 
<p>As our services are in high demand throughout the semester, we encourage students to make appointments in advance to ensure that they will get the help needed. Weekly appointments are available and strongly encouraged. </p>

        <p class="note">
        To make an appointment with a writing tutor at the Learning Support Center, call 773-442-4568.
        </p>
