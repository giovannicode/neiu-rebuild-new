        Tutors are selected based on their academic success and knowledge of their discipline. They are 
        juniors, seniors, graduate students, or professionals with majors in the field in which they tutor. 
        All tutors receive ongoing training to ensure that successful tutoring techniques are employed and students 
        are given an opportunity to be more academically engaged.

  <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
        
        <p>
           The Learning Support Center provides peer-based tutoring to undergraduate students 
           completing General Education courses, Math Development courses, and 
		assistance with writing assignments for all disciplines. Promoting students to become active participants 
           in the learning process and assisting them in understanding the skills, strategies and 
           techniques needed to achieve academic success is the primary emphasis. Through 
           collaboration with the other academic support offices, students are provided with 
           informed cooperative assistance. The Learning Support Center affords students the opportunity 
           to interact with faculty, staff and tutors in a supportive environment as they become active and independent learners.
