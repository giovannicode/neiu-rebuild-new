	        Orientation is designed to support and enhance the new student transition to the University 
	        by taking a holistic approach to student development and transition, with the ultimate goal 
	        of positively impacting student success.
	        </p>
        
         <p class="para1">
         The mission of Orientation programming is to assist new students with a successful transition
         to Northeastern Illinois University by preparing students for the academic, social, and cultural
         opportunities and climate of the University, while also supporting parents, partners, guardians, and 
         children of new students.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         The mission and goals of Orientation are grounded by NEIU's strategic plan. Orientation supports student success,
         which is goal one of the strategic plan. Specifically, the program focuses on two action steps within goal one:
         1.3: Raise undergraduate and graduate student recruitment, retention, and graduation rates, including those for
         students from historically underrepresented groups, to specific University benchmarks and goals.
         1.5: Improve coordination among student and academic support programs and services with a focus on quality,
         customer service, and intentional integration with the curriculum.
