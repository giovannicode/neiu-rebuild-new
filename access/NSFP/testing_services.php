	        <p>
	        Registration for all Placement Tests can be done <a href="testing-registration.php">online</a>, in person at Testing Services located on the 5th floor of the C Building, by calling at 1-773-442-5293. Please refer to the current Math and English Placement Test schedule for the testing dates. Any cancellations 
	        or changes must be made 48 hours in advance. A student who fails to appear 3 times for his/her appointed time will not be eligible for further 
	        registration of the test but will have to rely on walk-in availability.

	   <h3>Placement Test Start Times</h3>
	   <p>The Math, Writing, and Reading Placement Tests are expected to start based on the following schedule. For instance, if the official Placement Test schedule states that there is a Placement test starting at 9:00 AM on one Saturday, the Math portion begins at 9:00 AM, followed by Writing at 10:20 AM and Reading at 11:00 AM. The entire test session ends at 12:10 PM.</p>

<p>No test starts earlier than the time specified, and there might be a slight delay due to the check-in process. However, students are strongly advised to arrive at the test site at least 20 minutes before the stated start time. <strong>Nobody will be admitted once the test has begun.</strong></p>

	        <h3>The Math Placement Test</h3>
	        
	        <p>
	        The Math Placement Test (MPT) evaluates your initial course readiness to be successful in mathematics at Northeastern 
	        Illinois University. The university does not allow students to register for any mathematics course without prior testing (MPT or ACT) or 
	        college-level coursework. If a student wants to retake the test then the student will have to wait for one calendar year.
	        </p>
	        
	        <br/>
	        
	        <h4>Freshmen</h4>
	        <p>
	        All entering freshman students are given two options for placement into a math course:  ACT Math score or the Math Placement Test (MPT).  Freshmen who submit ACT 
	        scores to the university can be placed directly into a math course solely based on their ACT math score.  They also have the option of taking the Math 
	        Placement Test (MPT), in which case the university will use the higher of the two scores for placement into a math course.  Since there is no penalty to taking the
MPT, freshmen are strongly encouraged to do so, particularly if they took a math course in their senior year of high school. 
	        </p>
	        
	        <p class="listing">
	        The Math Placement Test is designed as Basic and Advanced.
	        </p>
	        <ul class="listingBullet">
	           <li>Freshmen with Math ACT scores of 21 or less are given the Basic MPT and 22 or higher are given the Advanced MPT.  </li>
	           <li>Freshmen who do not submit ACT scores must take the Basic MPT.</li>
	           <li>Freshmen who receive a score of '3' or higher on the AP Calculus test are not required to take the MPT. </li>
	         </ul>
	         
	         </br>
	         
	         <h4>Transfers</h4>
	         
	         <p>
	         Transfer students who have not successfully completed college-level coursework in mathematics at their prior institution are required to take the Math Placement Test.  
	         </p>
	         
	         <p class="listing">

	         <ul class="listingBullet">
	            <li>Transfer students who receive a grade of 'C' or better in Intermediate Algebra at their transfer institution do not need to take the MPT. However, since Intermediate Algebra is not a 
	            college-level course, they will be required to provide proof of course completion in the form of a transcript to the Mathematics Department, in order to obtain permission to 
	            register for additional math courses at NEIU.</li>
	            <li>Transfer students who have submitted their ACT scores can be placed into a math course solely based on their ACT math score.</li>

	        <h3>The English Placement Test</h3>
	        
	        <p>
	        The purpose of the English Placement Test (EPT) is to place students in appropriate English classes so they can not only satisfy the 
	        University's English composition requirement, but also so they can be prepared for their general education and major courses. 
	        </p>
	        
	        <br/>
	        
	        <h4>Who needs to take the English Placement Test?</h4>
	        
	        <p>
	        The English Placement Test (EPT) is given to all incoming freshmen and transfer students who have not successfully completed ENGL 101 or an 
	        equivalent course at their previous institution. The EPT is divided into two parts: a writing test and a reading test. 
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>
	        Not all students are required to take the reading portion of the EPT. Students who enter the university with an ACT reading score of 20 or higher, will be excused from taking the reading portion of the English Placement Test but they still need to take the writing portion.
	        </p>
	        
	        <p class="note">
	       If a student wants to retake the test, he or she will have to wait for one calendar year.
