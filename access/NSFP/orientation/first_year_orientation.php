                 <h3>First Year Student Orientation</h3>




<p>Welcome to Northeastern Illinois University! We are excited that you have selected Northeastern to pursue your undergraduate education. First-Year Orientation will familiarize you with the campus and Northeastern expectations, as well as provide an opportunity to meet other first-year students and faculty.</p>

<p>Your day-long orientation will also involve interacting with Northeastern's talented Orientation Leaders (OLs), who will assist your transition to Northeastern. As part of the orientation program, you will meet your advisor and register for fall classes. Orientation check-in begins at 8:00 a.m. and ends at approximately 6:00 p.m. Please plan to be present for the full day. <strong>First-year students are required to attend Orientation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>All first-year Students must participate in one of the Orientation Sessions offered throughout the summer. It is strongly recommended that you attend a June or July Orientation, as class availability is limited later in the summer.</strong></p>

<h5 class="show">Placement Tests</h4>

<div class="hide">
<p>To help you begin course work at the appropriate level, all new first-year students are <strong>REQUIRED</strong> to take placement tests prior to orientation.  You are required to take placement testing in English (Reading and Writing) and Math.  With your test results, an advisor will be able to discuss with you during orientation where you can best begin your ucourse work in these subjects.</p>
<p>Remember, all placement testing needs to be done <strong>THREE WEEKS PRIOR</strong> to your Orientation date.</p>
<p>If you need more information about Northeastern's placement tests and have not registered to take your placement tests, please visit the <a href="http://www.neiu.edu/~saffairs/access/NSFP/testing_services.php">Testing Services web page</a> to learn more about placement tests and how to register online.</p>

<h5 class="show">Orientation Dates and Deadlines</h4>
<div class="hide"><p>First-Year Orientation dates start in June and end in August. The following are the available dates we are offering for first year student sessions. You must participate in one date during the summer. You will be offered an Orientation date based on the date of your point of entry (e.g., Carruther's Center for Inner City Studies, El Centro, Project Success, or Proyecto Pa'Lante) into the University, and/or your intended major. You will be able to sign up for a date provided there is still space available.  Because space is limited and available on a first come first served basis, it is advised that you find 2 or 3 dates that you are able to attend.  Please note the deadline dates below that indicate when the session will be closed and you will no longer be able to sign up for it.</p>

<div>
<h5 class="show">Advising at Orientation</h4>
<div class="hide">
<p>Advising is an educational process by which you are integrated into the University community. This is accomplished by assisting you in the transition from high school to college, providing accurate information about academic major requirements, promoting learning and utilization of academic and campus resources, and facilitating academic major and career exploration. During Orientation you will participate in an advising experience.  You will select your fall semester classes, learn about academic program requirements, academic policies and procedures, and other services that will help you achieve your academic success.</p>

<p>Enrollment in courses for Fall semester takes place during your Orientation session. Whether you attend the first or the last Orientation session, you will find a wide range of available courses, including courses that meet General Education, major and degree requirements. Because of the high demand for a particular session date, it is important to sign up for your Orientation session online as early as possible. All students attending Orientation will be able to find courses for the Fall Semester.</p>
