<p>Welcome to Northeastern Illinois University! We are excited that you have selected Northeastern to pursue your undergraduate education. Orientation will familiarize you with the campus and Northeastern expectations, as well as provide an opportunity to meet other new students and faculty.</p>

        <h4>Mission and Goals</h4> 
		
<p>Orientation is designed to support and enhance students' transition to the University 
	        by taking a holistic approach to student development and transition, with the ultimate goal 
	        of positively impacting student success.
	        </p>
<p>
         The mission of Orientation programming is to assist new students with a successful transition
         to Northeastern Illinois University by preparing students for the academic, social, and cultural
         opportunities and climate of the University, while also supporting parents, partners, guardians, and 
         children of new students.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         The mission and goals of Orientation are grounded by Northeastern's strategic plan. Orientation supports student success,
         which is goal one of the strategic plan. Specifically, the program focuses on two action steps within goal one:

         students from historically underrepresented groups, to specific University benchmarks and goals.</li>
<li>1.5: Improve coordination among student and academic support programs and services with a focus on quality,
         customer service, and intentional integration with the curriculum.</li>
		 </ul>
         </p>
