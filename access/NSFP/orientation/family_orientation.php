	   <p class="para1">
	   Congratulations, your student has selected to attend Northeastern Illinois University, a public comprehensive university 
	   with locations throughout Chicago that provides an exceptional environment for learning, teaching, and scholarship. We 
	   prepare a diverse community of students for leadership and service in our region and in a dynamic multicultural world.
	   </p>
   

   
	   <p>
	   Many students have a great deal of support during their journey to this University and this support should continue. 
	   The encouragement and support you offer family members attending NEIU are important factors that play a role in ensuring 
	   their academic success. The more you know about the higher education experience, the better you will be able to help your 
	   family members achieve their educational goals. Family Orientation is designed to give you the opportunity to learn more 
	   about NEIU and what your student will experience, ask questions of staff, and take a campus tour. This experience will also 
	   provide information about various academic programs and services available to your student(s).
       </p>
     
       <br>
  
   
	   <p>
	   Complimentary parking is available on levels 4 and 5 of the Parking Facility during family orientation.
