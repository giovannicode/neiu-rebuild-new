        The mission of Student Health Services is to provide a wide array of wellness, illness and health promotion services to our students.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Our services are available to all currently enrolled NEIU students with a valid I.D., and are generally free of charge.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        All currently enrolled students at NEIU pay a Student Health Service fee; this fee covers most services, tests, medications, information, and materials provided by Student Health Services.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The one exception to this is contraception; there is a minimal charge for the oral contraceptives we have available, although condoms are free.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The nurse practitioner provides well-woman gynecological care as well as STD testing. She is available 
        Monday through Thursday during the fall and spring semesters. and two days a week during the summer semester.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The nurses provide assessment, treatment, and follow-up for a wide range of complaints and
         problems. Use us as your first line of care; we may refer you to your physician if the
          situation cannot be fully dealt with in the Student Health Services Office.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We have a large assortment of brochures and visual displays in the Student Health Services Office. Many are located in the hallway for easy access.
