           <p class="question">Who is eligible for Student Health Insurance?</p>

             <li>All full-time (12 or more hours) undergraduate students are automatically enrolled in the 
             insurance plan. Undergraduates taking 6 -12 hours and graduate students taking at least

           <ul class="questionBullet">
             <li>No. If you have insurance equal to or more comprehensive than the student insurance plan, you can obtain a 
             waiver. The insurance may be waived by filling out a form in the cashier's office. The form is also available 
             online <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neiu.edu/DOCUMENTS/About_NEIU/Administration/VP_-_Finance_Administration/Bursar/InsWaiverForm.pdf">here</a>. Please fill out the form and return to the cashier's office with proof of insurance.

           <ul class="questionBullet">
