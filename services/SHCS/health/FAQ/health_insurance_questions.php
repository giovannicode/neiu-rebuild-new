           <p class="question">Who is eligible for Student Health Insurance?</p>
           
           <ul class="questionBullet">
             <li>All full-time (12 or more hours) undergraduate students are automatically enrolled in the 
             insurance plan. Undergraduates taking 6 -12 hours and graduate students taking at least 
             3 hours are eligible, but must request the insurance at the cashier's office.</li>
          </ul>
           
           <p class="question">I already have health insurance. Do I have to keep the school's policy, too?</p>
           
           <ul class="questionBullet">
             <li>No. If you have insurance equal to or more comprehensive than the student insurance plan, you can obtain a 
             waiver. The insurance may be waived by filling out a form in the cashier's office. The form is also available 
             online <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neiu.edu/DOCUMENTS/About_NEIU/Administration/VP_-_Finance_Administration/Bursar/InsWaiverForm.pdf">here</a>. Please fill out the form and return to the cashier's office with proof of insurance. 
               To waive the insurance online, visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aetnastudenthealth.com/stu_conn/student_connection.aspx?GroupID=697402">Aetna web site</a> and click on "Plans and Products" and then "Enroll/Waiver".</li>

           <ul class="questionBullet">

           <p class="question">What if I need to see a doctor before I get my insurance card?</p>

           <p class="question">How much is the insurance per semester?</p>

             <li>The price of the insurance policy for the Fall 2011 and Spring 2012 semesters is $687.75 per semester. 
             Spring semester students paying for health insurance will be covered through summer. Summer semester insurance

          </ul>
