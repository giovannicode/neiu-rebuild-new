        Counseling is provided in both individual and group formats. In group counseling, you meet with a 
        counselor along with several other students, and together explore areas of common concern. Group sessions 
        are usually scheduled once a week, and the combined experiences and support of other group members can 
        make this a very powerful form of helping.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In group counseling (also called group therapy or simply "group"), up to eight individuals meet 
        face-to-face with a group therapist and talk about what is troubling them. Members also give 
        feedback to each other by expressing their own feelings about what someone says or does. This 
        interaction gives group members an opportunity to try out new ways of behaving and to learn more about 
        the way they interact with others. What makes the situation unique is that it is a safe environment 
        with clear boundaries. Group sessions are confidential; what people talk about or disclose is not discussed outside the group.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Some groups run by Student Counseling Services office are general in 
        their content, while others focus on certain issues, like grief or relationships. Discuss 
        with a counselor which groups are currently available and a good match to your concerns.
