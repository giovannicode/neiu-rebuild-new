          Northeastern's Counseling Services provides training opportunities for those pursuing careers 
          in Clinical Psychology. We offer both Postdoctoral Fellowships and Predoctoral Therapy Practicum placements.
          </p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h5>Mission and Philosophy of Training</h5>
          
          <p>
          In the context of the larger University, Counseling Services provides an environment rich with 
          opportunities for learning and deepening skills. In many ways more a community mental health center 
          than a traditional college counseling center, our office provides services for a community that is
           broadly diverse across all dimensions and that presents an equally broad range of clinical issues. 
           Postdoctoral fellows and predoctoral practicum students participate in all aspects of our 
           office's activities. We view clinical training as an advanced apprenticeship in a service 
           environment committed to ongoing learning, professional independence and reflection about practice.
          </p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h5>Characteristics of the student body and our clients</h5>
          
          <p>
          One of the most diverse universities in the Midwest, Northeastern has a population 
          that represents students and staff members from a wide range of ages, ethnic backgrounds, 
          socio-economic levels, gender identities, and cultural and religious groups. Over 60% of
           Northeastern's students are the first in their families to pursue a college education,
            and many are "non-traditional" students, coming from groups underrepresented in higher 
            education. Significant numbers of returning adults also compliment this diversity. 
            Because many of our students are in the process of a life transition, they experience 
            high levels of stress as they balance the often competing worlds of school, work, and home.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Below is a table with demographic characteristics of Northeastern's Counseling Services population, 
          based on the most recent data from Fall 2012. Client utilization data over the past several years
           indicate that Counseling Services' clientele closely follows the  pattern of NEIU's overall 
           population, including both ethnic background and age. Approximately 90% of the treatment 
           provided last year took the form of individual sessions, with additional couple/family 
           therapy, and group counseling.

          <h3>About Counseling Services</h3>
          
          <p>
          Student Health and Counseling Services is a service unit within the Division of Student Affairs, 
          the area responsible for the many non-academic and co-curricular support needs of our students.
           Some of the other service units within the Division of Student Affairs include Career Services, 
           Campus Recreation and Student Leadership Development (formerly Student Activities), Tutoring, Advising, Disability Services, and 
           TRIO Support Services. Within this milieu, Counseling Services provides counseling services, outreach efforts 
           and crisis intervention to Northeastern students, along with consultation services for university faculty and administrative staff.
          </p>
          
          <br/>
          
          <h4> Services Provided</h4>
          
          <p>
          Counseling Services provides a range of outpatient clinical services to university 
          students and staff members. Primary clinical activities include individual, couple, 
          family and group psychotherapy, as well as outreach and consultation services.
          </p>

              <h5>Individual Psychotherapy</h5>
              
              <p>
              Individual psychotherapy is the most common service modality. What characterizes individual treatment at Northeastern is the very 
              diverse client population, representing a wide variety of background characteristics and clinical presentations. Psychological services 
              include crisis intervention and both brief and longer-term treatment.</p>
              
              <br>
              
              <h5>Couples and Family Psychotherapy</h5>
              <p>Although individual therapy is predominant, Counseling Services also provides couples and family therapy. Whether clients are seen individually or in couples is 
              determined primarily by client need and the clinical judgement of the therapist. During recent years, approximately 5% of the office's sessions 
              involved couple or family treatment.</p>
              
              <br>
              
              <h5>Group Psychotherapy</h5>
              <p>All clinical staff are encouraged to help develop therapy, support and psychoeducational groups on campus. These groups frequently have a 
              specific focus to address the needs of target audiences, and are sometimes sponsored in collaboration with other service units. 
              Previous groups have included an ongoing psychotherapy process groups, as well as counseling groups focusing on specific target
               populations and issues, such as anxiety management, stress management, parenting skills, a women's group and a group for students of color.</p>

         <p>
         Northeastern's Counseling Services has a long history of involvement in 
         various levels of clinical training. Originally serving as a practicum site for masters-level training, the office 
         began to offer pre-doctoral internships to students in Clinical Psychology in 1994. After 10 years of training interns, our office moved to a postdoctoral training model in 2004.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         The focus of the postdoctoral experience involves the development of professional independence and interests while completing supervised hours to meet licensure requirements. This is 
         accomplished by joining the clinical team with full involvement in office activities, including:
