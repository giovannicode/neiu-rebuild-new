        </p>
        
        <p>
        There may be times when employees wish to consult with a counselor about personal or relationship 
        concerns, an immediate crisis, or a variety of other life difficulties. While ongoing 
        counseling is provided only to registered students, it may be possible to speak with a 
        counselor to help decide how to approach the situation and where to find appropriate resources. 
        Faculty and staff are also eligible to attend therapy groups and workshops.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Counseling Services can also help connect employees with the 
        State of Illinois' Employee Assistance Program. There are several options, depending on 
        your employee classification. For full details, visit CMS' <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/cms/Employees/benefits/Pages/default.aspx">Employee Assistance Program</a> or 
        contact Human Resources at ext. 5202 for more information.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Finally, counselors are always available to help faculty or staff members understand the 
        psychological aspects of their work with students. Call us at ext. 4650 to explore any of 
        these options.
