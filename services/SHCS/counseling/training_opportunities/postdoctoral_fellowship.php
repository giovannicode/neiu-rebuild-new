          <h3>Postdoctoral Fellowship</h3>
         
         <br/>
         
         <h4>About the Postdoctoral Experience</h4>
         
         <p>
         Northeastern's Counseling Services has a long history of involvement in 
         various levels of clinical training. Originally serving as a practicum site for masters-level training, the office 
         began to offer pre-doctoral internships to students in Clinical Psychology in 1994. After 10 years of training interns, our office moved to a postdoctoral training model in 2004.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         The focus of the postdoctoral experience involves the development of professional independence and interests while completing supervised hours to meet licensure requirements. This is 
         accomplished by joining the clinical team with full involvement in office activities, including:
