        Northeastern Illinois University is committed to a set of shared values that, taken 
        collectively, guides our actions and interactions as we work together as a 
        community dedicated to fostering the responsible exercise of citizenship.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In establishing this community, it is necessary to communicate explicit 
        behavioral expectations to members of the University and ensure these 
        standards are consistently embraced and enforced.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The University expects all members to recognize the strength of personal differences, while respecting institutional 
        values. University community members are encouraged to think and act for themselves, as that is the purpose of 
        an institution of higher education. However, the University expects all members to understand that the 
        University has steadfast values in which it embraces with great enthusiasm.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Each community member has the right and obligation to make decisions about his or her own conduct. 
        Just as importantly, each member has the responsibility to accept the consequences of those decisions. 
        When an individual's behavior conflicts with the values of the University, the individual must choose 
        whether to adapt his or her behavior to coincide with University values or discontinue 
        their relationship with the University.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Student Rights and Responsibilities facilitates the balance of interests for individual 
        student and the community at-large, as well as preserves the integrity of the institution 
        and its values.

        values our metropolitan setting as a laboratory for learning, and we foster partnerships for learning, 
        research, and service throughout this dynamic region to promote the public good.
        </p>

        members of the University community. We are especially committed to transforming students' lives 
        by engaging them in an educational experience that empowers them to graduate with the skills and 
        knowledge to become effective leaders and citizens in their personal and professional lives.
