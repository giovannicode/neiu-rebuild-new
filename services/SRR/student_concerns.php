           <li><b>1. </b>A complaint may be submitted in writing to Student Rights and Responsibilities by completing a Request for Formal Review of a <a target="_blank" href="/services/SRR/files/Student%20Complaint%20Form.pdf">Student Complaint Form</a>.</li>
           <li><b>2. </b>When a student submits a complaint, he/she must also provide their name, contact information and attach any related documents.</li>
           <li><b>3. </b>After a complaint is submitted, the student will meet with the Director, an Assistant Director, or Coordinator to review the matter and be informed of the process.</li>
           <li><b>4. </b>The assigned staff member will then investigate the nature of the complaint, contact all necessary parties, and report back to the student with the outcome.</li>
           <li><b>5. </b>Additional follow-up will take place at the student's request until the matter is resolved.</li>
        </ul>
