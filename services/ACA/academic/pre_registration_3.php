          <h4>How to Choose Classes and Create a Schedule</h4>
          
          <p>
          To get you prepared for the Advising and Registration Workshop, we've developed the Pre-Registration Exercise that will teach you how to begin creating your 
          fall schedule. At the end of this exercise you will have completed a Registration Worksheet that you will bring to your orientation - your Advisor will 
          ask for the worksheet during your afternoon Advising/Registration session.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Please note that the final decision regarding your class schedule will be based upon class availability, your placement test scores 
          (which will be explained to you during your advising session), and discussion with your advisor.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          For this exercise, you will need to refer to the following PDF document: 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neiu.edu/Current%20Students/class-schedule/2013/schedule-lookup/class-schedule-pdf.html">Spring 2013 Schedule of Classes </a>
          </p>
          
          <p>

          Steps to Creating a Schedule: Goal: Choosing General Education and FYE Courses
          </p>
          
          <ul class="listingBullet">
             <li><b>1.</b> Look at the Time-Pattern Worksheet. Most of the classes you need to take are 3 semester hours and meet either 2 times a week (TR = Tuesday and Thursday, MW = Monday and Wednesday) for an hour and fifteen minutes per day, OR 3 times a week (MWF = Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for fifty minutes per day. The times that you take courses are up to you we've provided the Time Pattern Worksheet to help you plot your courses so that they don't overlap. </li>
             <li><b>2.</b> Using the Spring 2013 Schedule of Classes, look at the list of General Education Courses. General Education courses are divided into the following categories: Fine Arts, Social Behavioral Sciences, Natural Sciences, Humanities, and Math. For now, skip Math, and identify some courses that interest you in the other General Education categories. Remember, by the time you graduate you will have to take courses in each of these areas. </li>
             <li><b>3.</b> Choose three non-FYE courses that you would like to take this semester. </li>
             <li><b>4.</b> To find out what times and days the courses meet, go back to the Spring 2013 Schedule of Classes and look up your classes. Plot your choices on your Time Pattern Worksheet to make sure that the classes work together (times do not overlap). 
             </li>
             <li><b>5.</b> Using the Registration Worksheet, enter all the course information for your three course selections. (Dept) is the abbreviated department within each of the four General Education categories. (Course No)is the 3-digit number in front of the course title. (Section No) is the number in front of the time/day information for your class. (Reference #) is the 5-digit number in bold print at the end of the line containing the section, time, day, etc. For example, if you chose to take Music 101, The Musical Experience from 12:00 - 12:50 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and History 215, U.S. History 1877 - Present from 10:50 - 12:05 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the information on your Registration Worksheet would look like this: </li>

    <br/>
            
            
             <li><b>6.</b> Next, choose two FYE courses from the following link: Spring 2013 FYE Brochure. Although freshmen take only one FYE course, we are asking you to select two in case one is already closed.  Plot these on your Time Pattern Worksheet to make sure that they do not interfere with your other courses.  (NOTE:  Your FYE courses can both be at the same time they don't have to be, but they can since you will only be taking one of them. </li>
             <li><b>7.</b> Repeat Step 5 (enter the course information on your Registration Worksheet).</li>
             <li><b>8.</b> Bring the completed Registration Worksheet with you to your Advisement session and show it to your advisor. </li>
          </ul>
