          Here's what we'll be covering on the following pages: 
          </p>

          <h4>General Education Program Requirements </h4>
          
          <p class="listing">
          Every student, regardless of major, is required to complete the General Education Program which consists of 13 courses distributed among the following five areas:
          </p>
          
          <ul class="listingBullet">
             <li><b>Fine Arts</b> - 2 courses</li>
             <li><b>Humanities</b> - 3 courses</li>
             <li><b>Social Behavioral Sciences</b> - 4 courses </li>
             <li><b>Natural Sciences</b> - 3 courses (one of which MUST be a lab course) </li>
             <li><b>Math/Quantitative Reasoning</b> - 1 course</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
          Most full-time students complete these courses by the end of their Sophomore year. General Education, Math, English and Reading are usually the 
          only courses from which you may choose during your first Fall and Spring Semesters at Northeastern.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Certain majors require that you take specific General Education courses; this pertains especially to 
          the Social Work major, to all majors in the College of Business and Management, and to majors in the College of Education. 
          If you are thinking about majoring in one of these areas, it's especially important that you let your advisor know. 
          Even if you're not absolutely certain, your advisor will make sure that you are taking as many courses as possible that 
          meet specific General Education Requirements AND Major/Prerequisite Requirements.
          </p>
          
          <br/>
          
          
          <h4>First Year Experience (FYE) Requirement</h4>
          
          <p>
			As you look through the list of general education courses in the Spring 2013 Schedule of Classes, pay close attention to the courses 
			with an asterisk (*) and an FYE title. FYE stands for First Year Experience and all new entering freshmen are required to 
			take one of these FYE courses within their first year.
          </p>
          
          <br/>
          
          <h4>English and Math Requirements </h4>
          
          <p>
          Along with General Education courses, students need to take English, Math, and in some cases, Reading courses, beginning their first 
          semester. There are different levels of English, Math, and Reading: your Placement Test and ACT scores will determine the 
          level at which you begin. Although college level Math is a General Education requirement, many students place into 
          developmental courses that must be completed first.
