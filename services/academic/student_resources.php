           Academic and Career Advising provide students with the tools and 
           resources to discover, define and accomplish their academic and career goals. 
           Academic advisors provide academic and developmental advising for all undergraduate 
           students who have not declared majors. Students remain with their University advisors 
           until they declare a major, at which time the major department will assign a major 
           advisor. Academic Advisors are available for students interested in pre-law and 
           pre-professional health sciences programs. Career advisors assist students in 
           developing appropriate major and career options through individual appointments, 
           assessments, job fairs, and workshops. Career advisors also assist alumni with the 
           successful transition of their academic credentials to the workforce. Academic and 
           Career advisors help students to take responsibility for their academic choices in 
           support of their career aspirations.-->
