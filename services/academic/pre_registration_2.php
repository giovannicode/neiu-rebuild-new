          <h4>Why It Is Important to Declare a Major Soon!</h4>
          
          <p>
          It's a good idea to decide on a major as soon as possible. Some majors take a longer time to complete than others, and some have very specific General Education requirements: 
          the sooner you decide on a major, the less likely it will be that you'll have to take extra General Education classes. For assistance with choosing a 
          major, be sure to meet with your advisor during the fall semester to begin the career planning process.
          </p>
          
          <br/>
          
          <h5>How Many Classes Should YOU Take? </h5>
          
          <p>
          Most incoming Freshmen start with an English Composition course and a Mathematics course as determined by their placement exams. If you plan to 
          attend full-time, you will need to select two to four additional courses. These are usually chosen from the General Education Program List of approved Courses.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Full-time students take a minimum of four courses and a maximum of six courses their first semester, totaling between 12 and 18 credit hours. If you plan to graduate in four 
          years, you will need to complete a total of 30 credit hours of college-level coursework each year. This can be done by completing at least five classes,
           totaling 15 credit hours, each Fall and Spring semester and/or taking some classes during the Summer semester.
          </p>

          <span class="note">NOTE: MATH 090, MATH 091, MATH 092, ELP 090 and ELP 099 are NOT college-level.</span> Before deciding how many hours to enroll for each semester, think carefully 
          about how much time you have for school and whether you will be working. <span class="note"><br/>DO NOT plan to work full-time and go to school full-time!</span>
