		        <p>
		        Resumes, interviews, elevator speeches, and LinkedIn profiles are some of the communications tools that you need as a viable job candidate. Examples are presented to get you started.

		        <p>
		        Without targeted objectives and effective research, you cannot identify and define the hiring needs of an organization. Career Advising can help design an effective 
		        strategy to your job search so you won't "spin your wheels" by only responding to job boards. Instead, we help you to mine the hidden job market for opportunities.

		        <p>
		        Networking is establishing relationships and communicating with people as sources of information and referrals. Career experts believe that between 60% to 80% of jobs 
		        are found by networking. Here are some Chicago area resources for networking opportunities.
