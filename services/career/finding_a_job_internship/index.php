        At Career Advising, we are here to support you with your career goals.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Career Advising assists Northeastern students and alumni developing appropriate major and career
         options through individual appointments, assessments, job fairs, workshops, and many other on and off-campus events.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We encourage students to explore jobs in real-world settings, through occupational research and informational interviews, job shadows, volunteering opportunities, and internships.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We can help you find internship opportunities to explore career options. We offer resume critiquing, interview preparation, 
        and workshops to polish your professional skills. We keep you informed on the job market by offering listserv notices, a 
        Facebook page, and listings of job fairs both on-campus and locally. These services and more can be found on our web site, 
        along with more resources within our office (B-119). (See the Quick Links on the right for some useful websites to assist you in your job/internship search.)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We look forward to the opportunity to assist you with your career goals.
