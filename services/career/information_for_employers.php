        Career Advising is excited to partner with you to find talented students and alumni for your company's 
        growth and success! Career Advising invites you to utilize our employer services during the upcoming 
        academic year. We are here to assist in posting both part-time and full-time jobs and internships, 
        scheduling on-campus interviews and information sessions, registering for career fairs, exploring 
        partnership and sponsorship opportunities, and developing a campus recruiting plan to help you hire the best and brightest.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We have two offices to fit your needs. Our <a href="/services/career/career/student_employment_office.php">Student Employment Office</a> works with non-degreed students 
        to secure employment both on and off campus. As an employer, you can post a job, schedule an 
        information table in our popular Village Square area, and/or schedule an information session.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Career Advising handles employment at the internship or degree required level. Our services also include job postings and 
        information sessions, as well as the more traditional on-campus recruitment process. For traditional on-campus 
        recruitment, we will set up a date for you to recruit on-campus 3-4 weeks in advance. You will provide the 
        degree-required or internship position descriptions, and we will advertise these to our students and 
        alumni via email, flyers, faculty announcements, etc. Interested students and alumni will submit 
        resumes, which will then be forwarded to the recruitment contact. Your representative then 
        selects who will participate in interviews that day. Once selections are made, our office will schedule the interviews for you.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The complete list of majors offered by NEIU is also linked on this page, 
        to assist you in identifying the student groups you would be most interested in contacting.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Please let us know if we can be of any further assistance in helping you find our best and brightest students!

        <h3>How To Post Jobs and Internships</h3>
        
        <p>
        As an employer, you may post employment opportunities at no cost by mail, fax, or via our 
        online job posting site. To access our online site, College Central Network Services (CCN), 
        click on the CCN logo, and choose "Employers." At the site you will get an I.D. and register 
        for a password, making multiple and future postings simpler. Your job opening(s) stay up on 
        our web-based job board for 30 days, or until a date of your choosing.

        <h3>On-Campus Recruitment</h3>
        
        <p>
        Career Advising will assist you in setting up interviews with qualified candidates pursuant to your job requirements.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        On-Campus interviews may be set up via phone or email for degree-required positions. Interviews 
        may be arranged on a "prescreen" or "open sign-up" basis. If you decide to prescreen the 
        candidates, resumes will be collected and you will approve candidates for interview prior 
        to the interview date. Career Advising has found that setting a date a month prior to the 
        interview date is most beneficial to employers. If you choose an "open sign-up" schedule, 
        any student meeting your requirements may sign up for an interview.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        If you have any questions regarding on-campus recruitment, please contact our office at (773) 442-4680.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        If you are interested in recruiting for part-time, non-degreed employees, please contact Cathy Duffy, 
        Program Administrative Assistant, Job Location and Development Program, (773) 442-4692 or ext. 4692, C-Duffy1@neiu.edu.
