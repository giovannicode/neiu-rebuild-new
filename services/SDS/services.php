         Visually impaired and legally blind students may receive accommodation 
          acuity may hinder a student's ability to perform at a level comparable to
           visual students. Students must have corrected vision no better than 20/70 for
            a diagnosis of a visual impairment. After a visual impairment is diagnosed as 
            stable, vision may continue to deteriorate.

            Students who are legally blind have less than 20/200 vision in the 
            better eye or a very limited field of vision. Their vision may be blurred, cloudy, 
            double, or spotted. Sometimes, peripheral vision or central vision may be impaired. 
            Students experiencing any of these visual problems should contact the center.

         The major challenge facing deaf/hearing impaired students is communication, and
          various communication methods are often utilized. In academic settings, speech
           reading (lip reading), manual communication (sign language or finger spelling), and 
           writing are often needed. The Accessibility Center staff will assist students and their 
           faculty instructor with identifying the specific communication method that best facilitates 
           their academic goals and objectives within a class room environment.

            Students diagnosed with this disability may experience difficulty comprehending reading, writing, 
            mathematic calculations, listening and speaking. Since the disability is not discernable by 
            looking at an individual, students with one or all of these processing deficits often complain 
            how people may perceive them as stupid or lazy. They are neither, but instead learn or process information differently. 
            NEIU does not have a separate learning disability program but provides "reasonable accommodations" in compliance with federal mandates.

            <p>
            Each psychological evaluation submitted to the center must be complete. Each test report should be 
            signed and dated by a psychologist, with the diagnoses and tests administered as part of the report. 
            Services provided to the student must also be clearly depicted in the evaluation provided by the student 
            to the center. Further, in order to receive accommodations, the psychological evaluation submitted by the 
            student can not be any older than three years from the students' Accessibility Center self-identification

            <p>
            Psychiatric impairments or mental illnesses cover a myriad of disorders, and they are not discernable to 
            the eye. Some students suffer from manic depression, panic, bi-polar, and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, 
            depression, paranoia, compulsive and obsessive behaviors. These conditions have the propensity to alter attention 
            spans, concentration, personality, behavior, hygiene, or self-confidence. Students diagnosed with any of these 
            disorders may experience an inability to develop or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers; 
            inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances; heightened anxieties, fears, or suspicions; 
            and/or difficulty concentrating and making decisions.
            </p>
            
            <p class="listing">Individuals who self-identify as having a psychiatric impairment should follow the following guidelines when requesting accommodations through the Accessibility Center:</p>
            
            <ul class="listingBullet">

               <li>Arrive early to secure a seat near the door to avoid distractions if you have to leave. However if you know you will have to stand and stretch due to an adverse reaction to medicine please discuss this problem with your instructor when you self-identify in his/her office.</li>
               
               <li>Request note taking assistance, taped class lectures, and exams in a distraction free room and/or in adapted formats, if needed.</li>
               
               <li>Contact your Accessibility Center counselor about contacting the Health Service Office on campus to store your medication during the semester, if needed.</li>
               
               <li>If hospitalization is needed, please contact your instructors and Accessibility Center staff counselor.</li>
