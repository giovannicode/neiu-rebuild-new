         <p class="para1">
        The major challenge facing students who are deaf/hard-of-hearing is communication, and various communication methods are often utilized.  In academic settings, speech reading (lip reading), manual communication (sign language or finger spelling), and writing are often needed.  The Student Disability Services (SDS) staff will assist students and their faculty instructor with identifying the specific communication method that best facilitates their academic goals and objectives within a class room environment.  Listed below are helpful hints for students who are deaf/hard-of-hearing to follow when services are needed.
