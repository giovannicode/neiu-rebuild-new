	<br />
Presenters:  Dr. Elaine Blair, Academic and Career Advising; Linda Davis, Academic and Career Advising
	<br />
Session Description: Student retention and persistence is “The Real Deal.”  Students attend universities and colleges to gain an education and to graduate.  It is imperative that we continue to provide support to students through mentoring activities which can ensure persistence.   Proactively engaging students to help them adjust and succeed in college is vital.

<em>Engaging First Generation Students	</em><br />
Presenters: Brian Willess, New Student and Family Programs;   Robin Wagner, Academic and Career Advising	
<br />
Session Description:  First Generation Students (FGS) are not easily identified, but are an important subset of our student population. FGS are typically less prepared than those whose parents attended college. This lack of preparation results in less engagement with fellow students and faculty as well as a higher dropout rate before completion of their degree. This roundtable discussion will address the challenges facing FGS and how we can foster a more inclusive environment for this largely ignored population.

<em>Integrating Leadership: From Accomplished Students to Qualified Professionals</em><br />	
Presenters: Tina Garcia, Student Leadership Development; Michelle Scott, Student Affairs<br />
Session Description: In this presentation, we will examine how leadership functions in student development and professional development. We hope to trace how NASPA presenters offered insight into how a student’s leadership development during college can translate in that student’s future professional career. To do this, we will bridge leadership research conducted in the areas of student leadership development and human resources.
